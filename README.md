# TeenLifeSimulator

Initial JavaScript scaffolding for the Teen Life Simulator using the systems described in `spec.md`. The code models grades, allowances, chores, fashion popularity decay, rumors, friendships, romance, and a basic month-end loop.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` runs `src/demo.js`, which demonstrates the core systems and logs state updates to the console.
