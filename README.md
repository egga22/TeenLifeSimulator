# Teen Life Simulator

Lightweight prototype of the core simulation systems for a teen life sim, powered by plain JavaScript.

## Running in the browser
Open `index.html` directly in any modern browser. No build tools or server are required. The page includes controls to exercise the study, rumor, fashion, chore, friendship, romance, and skipping-school systems and shows a live activity log.

## Running the console demo (optional)
If you prefer a quick console walkthrough, install Node 18+ and run:

```bash
node src/demo.js
```
